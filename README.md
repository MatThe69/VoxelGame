A Basic Voxel (Engine) slash (Game), just made as a random hobby project for fun. :)

# WARNING!
Right now as it implemented, the more voxel you generate, the more memeory it takes up!!
I am not sure how to fix this at the moment, but I am defiantly looking into you! If you have any advice, you're more than welcome to let me know!

# What is the purpose?
It is mainly for fun, but also to oberserve simple rules behave in more complex ways. A few days ago I saw a video about tiles (or cells) that given simple rules, acted in varies ways. It was 2D, so I thought to myself, why not 3D? And I've been waniting to do something with voxel (other than making another Minecraft-Clone).

# How to download and use it youself?
- Get Project
Download the "VoxelGame.zip" zip file, and extract the folder "Voxel Game". I recommend using the newest Visual Studio 22.
I will be try to make into a Cmake file so its easier for people who aren't using Visual Studio or the newest Visual Studio.
- Get EXE File
Download the "Game.zip" zip file, and extract the Game folder. There should be a Res folder (Resource). And a "VoxelGame.exe" which is the actual game.

# Key(s)
Camera Movement: W - Forward, S - Backward, A - Left, D - Right.
Spawn Movement: Up - Forward, Down - Backward, Left - Left, Right - Right.
I - Continuesoly spawns Voxel (Currently just Sand)

# Voxel(s)
- Sand : Rule; Checks underneath, then down-left, down-right, down-front and down-back if any of those of the first statement is true, moves there!
